module load python3/3.11.1
python generate_circus_ini.py
circusd circus.ini
Then:

bash
Copy code
module load python3/3.11.1
circusweb --endpoint tcp://127.0.0.1:5555
Open circus-web in the browser.

Will see watchers like:

A_monitor_P001

A_monitor_P002

B_monitor_P001

…

Each one:

Starts automatically when circusd starts (autostart = true)

If the process crashes or exits, Circus does not restart it because respawn = False

The status in web UI becomes “stopped”

Can click Restart as many times as you want

Restart runs the script with --reset, so it clears that monitor’s CSV and JSON and recollects from scratch for that (monitor, project) only

Other monitors and other projects are not touched.

If ever want a monitor that does auto restart, just set respawn = True for that watcher only.
